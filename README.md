Old-school looking survival game made in Monogame/XNA.

# Building the Project
This project used Monogame. To install it, [follow these steps](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/getting_started/1_setting_up_your_development_environment_windows.html) from their site.

Then insteall their editor, [found here](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tools/mgcb_editor.html).

Then run that mgcb editor in visual studio and "build" it for the first time. After that you can build the game.
